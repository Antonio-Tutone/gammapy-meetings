# Gammapy July 2018 Coding Sprint, Heidelberg

* Start: Monday, July 9, 2018 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, July 13, 2018 at noon
* Location: MPIK Heidelberg, Germany (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/)

This is a "coding sprint" for people that want to work on Gammapy (http://gammapy.org/)
You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to Gammapy yet.
But note that this is not a workshop how to use Gammapy.

So far Gammapy has been mostly developed and used by people working on CTA and H.E.S.S.
But of course anyone is welcome! If you're from MAGIC, VERITAS, HAWC, KM3Net, ... and have time to come and talk to us, please do!

## Agenda

We will define the agenda before the meeting.

Probably we will do overview presentations (status, proposals) on Monday afternoon
and then leave the rest of the week free for people to work in small groups.
See [here](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-meetings/tree/master/2018-02-05#preliminary-agenda)
for the agenda we had at the last Gammapy coding sprint as an example.

At previous meetings we did extensive Gammapy developer tutorials.
If there is demand, we can do some developer tutorials, but we don't plan to spend too much time on this.
Instead we will do pair coding, i.e. learning by doing.
If you aren't familiar much yet with Python, pytest, git and Github, please use the information and resources
linked to at https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-dev-tutorial to learn a bit before the meeting.

## Registered Participants

# Gammapy July 2018 Coding Sprint, Heidelberg

* Start: Monday, July 9, 2018 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, July 13, 2018 at noon
* Location: MPIK Heidelberg, Germany (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/)

This is a "coding sprint" for people that want to work on Gammapy (http://gammapy.org/)
You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to Gammapy yet.
But note that this is not a workshop how to use Gammapy.

So far Gammapy has been mostly developed and used by people working on CTA and H.E.S.S.
But of course anyone is welcome! If you're from MAGIC, VERITAS, HAWC, KM3Net, ... and have time to come and talk to us, please do!

## Travel and hotel

If you haven't been to Heidelberg or MPIK, you can find some information [here](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/contact/access-and-site-map/). MPIK is located a bit up the hill outside of Heidelberg, a 10 min ride with bus 39 will get you there.

To book a hotel or Airbnb, please do it yourself.
Good areas are downtown or Weststadt or Südstadt, i.e. near the bus line 39 that you will want to take to go to MPIK.
But really, Heidelberg is small and there are no "bad neighborhoods", you can stay anywhere you like.

There is the option to stay at the MPIK guest house. It's cheap, 35 Euro / night, see [price list](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/fileadmin/files-mpi/2015_price_list_MPIK_guest_houses.pdf), good WIFI and easy to book by filling out [this form](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/information-for/reservation/#2899). But most people prefer to stay in downtown Heidelberg to see a bit from the city and to have a shorter way home in the evening after dinner. There is no canteen at MPIK, only at nearby EMBL where we also go for lunch, and it closes at 7 pm.

Let us know if you have any questions!

## Agenda

We will define the agenda before the meeting.

Probably we will do overview presentations (status, proposals) on Monday afternoon
and then leave the rest of the week free for people to work in small groups.
See [here](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-meetings/tree/master/2018-02-05#preliminary-agenda)
for the agenda we had at the last Gammapy coding sprint as an example.

At previous meetings we did extensive Gammapy developer tutorials.
If there is demand, we can do some developer tutorials, but we don't plan to spend too much time on this.
Instead we will do pair coding, i.e. learning by doing.
If you aren't familiar much yet with Python, pytest, git and Github, please use the information and resources
linked to at https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-dev-tutorial to learn a bit before the meeting. There are also some good resources here: https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2018

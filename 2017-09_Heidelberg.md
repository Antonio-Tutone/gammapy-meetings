## About

This is not a "Gammapy user meeting" with tutorials / talks / how to get started
with analysis. We want to make some progress on Gammapy, i.e. just sit together
to discuss issues and pull request and do some coding (probably in small groups
of 2-3 people). This doesn't mean that you have to be an expert coder or
long-term contributor to Gammapy; if you want to add or improve something in
Gammapy, please join us and we'll try to make it happen or at least bring it on
a good way during this sprint.

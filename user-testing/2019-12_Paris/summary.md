# Summary of user feedback 

## Installation

- All users have used conda. 
- Smooth installation process for everybody. (Note some old conda versions)
- Some issues with getting gammapy-datasets: 
  * follow-up from installation to getting started
  * overwrite of older installations
  
## Documentation

### General
- Not enough information for basic users:
  * What are the methods applied? Statistics
    * E.g. significance, ring bkg etc
  * A glossary?
- Improve uniformity of docs
- Overview section is not what is expected for a science tool (not only a python package)
- Need workflow graphic

### Tutorials
- Used by everybody
- Lack of description/information
- They are not as self explanatory as we think
- More structure to improve readibility
  * e.g. core/advanced tutorials sections
  * Note: Once expanded tutorials hide the the rest of menu bar
- Not all links work (for classes and methods)
  *Having to browse from the tutorial is annoying 

### How-tos
- Only one person used them. Most did not see them. -> move them up
- Need more structure

### API doc 
- Used by ~50% of users
- Explicit code examples there not a necessity
- Absence of examples in docstring is regretted by several people

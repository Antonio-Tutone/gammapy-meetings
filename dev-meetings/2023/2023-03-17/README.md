# Agenda

* v1.0.1 has been released on March 14th
  * No major difficulties encountered
  * The necessary update to be done on the gammapy-webpage repo for  binder should be better documented
  * Note: it might be worth re-activating the creation of an independent Docker image to ease this
  * Question: should we hard-code the bugfix version of dependencies in the env.yaml file
  
* Coding sprint

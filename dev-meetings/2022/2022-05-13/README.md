# Agenda

Feedback from v0.20 release
* Among the recent changes:
  * both regions v0.5 and v0.6 are supported
  * minimal astropy version is 5.0 and python>=3.8
  * both iminuitand matplotlib are now required dependencies. 
* our development scheme beyond v1.0 is not ready, w.r.t. e.g. handling of dev and bugfix branches.
* We need to prepare a PIG for this. See an [early draft](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/3950)
* Try to organize discussion/training with astropy developper for post 1.0 dev workflow?
* Try to find a date for an in-person coding sprint in early summer?

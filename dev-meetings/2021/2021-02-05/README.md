* Handling of `CompoundRegion` vs list of `Region` (Axel)
* Handling of `RegionNDMap.get_spectrum()` or `PSFMap.to_region_nd_map()` (Axel)
* Introduce `PSFKernel.plot()` or make `PSFKernel` directly a `Map`?

    - Proposal: only allow strings where a scalar value is expected, when array input is supported, expect directly a Quantity

# Agenda

* [Gammapy pulse from last week](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pulse)
* [Open pull requests](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pulls)
* Short report by everyone, what they have worked on during the past week 

* Gammapy v0.18 released on Wednesday:
  - It's a nice release, with many new features an a lot fo cleanup: https://docs.gammapy.org/0.18/changelog.html
  - Thanks everyone for contributing! And helping to push for the release. Partly rushed from my side, that's why... 
  - A few (more or less) critical issues appeared, plan to fix and release v0.18.1 today...
* How to continue for v1.0?
  - There are still a few API changes planned, FluxMaps, BackgroundModel, SpectrumDataset? Do we want those to delivered in another
intermediate release? Or maybe we really introduce `v1.0.rc` or similar?

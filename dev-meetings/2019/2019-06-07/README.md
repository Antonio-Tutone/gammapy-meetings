# Agenda

* [Gammapy pulse from last week](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pulse)
* [Open pull requests](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pulls)

* Gammapy coding sprint will be July 15-19 in Erlangen ([LINK](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-meetings/tree/master/coding-sprints/2019-07-Erlangen)). It'll be awesome. Come join us!
* The Gammapy v0.13 development cycle has started. The release date has been set to July 22, 2019, i.e. the week after the coding sprint. See [milestone](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/milestone/18).
* We have started a big push on cleanup and quality in Gammapy. We are serious about the plan to release Gammapy v1.0 in October (see [roadmap](https://docs.gammapy.org/0.12/development/pigs/pig-005.html#releases)), which means we need to be very active in the coming weeks.
* We need help! Concretely, these are good issues to get involved with Gammapy development. They are rather small tasks to work on just one class or function, you don't have to know about all the other code or ongoing developments in Gammapy. Anyone is welcome to work on those and will get a mentor - if you're new to git and Github, that's fine. If you're interested (or know someone that is) - let us know any time!
  * Change CrabSpectrum factory class to a factory function ([GH 1788](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/1788))
  * Improve `cosmic_ray_flux` code and tests as described ([GH 2213](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/2213#issuecomment-499435699))
  * Add Gaussian spectral model. Important to test energy dispersion! ([GH 1411](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/1411))
  * Implement `PixRegion.rotate(center, angle)` for one or several pixel regions (see [here](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/blob/d0e434645cc9275cf28a867a582b657568d4e472/docs/development/pigs/pig-010.rst#rotated-regions))

# Core developer meeting in Heidelberg, Jan. 2019

Last year we've written a Gammapy roadmap (https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/1841)
to outline the development work for Gammapy in 2019 up to a v1.0 release in fall 2019.
In the roadmap we've defined 11 development projects of which each one should be implemented
via a correspondig proposal for improving Gammapy (PIG), coordinating and planning the work
in more detail.

The goal of this meeting is to coordinate and plan the development work for the first quartal
in 2019. Specifically to discuss about and write (finalize) the PIGs addressing the following
projects:

- Models (https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/1971)
- Datasets ()
- Data reduction / Map Analysis ()
- IRFs ()

For each PIG we want to define a list of 10-20 pull request to be implemented in the next ~3-4 few month.
For each PR we also define a milestone (ideally v0.10, v0.11 or v0.12) and a responsible person. Simple
tasks can be left un-assigned and e.g. implemented during the first Gammapy coding sprint by the end of
February 2019.

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **want to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop on how to use Gammapy.

This is the first in-person coding-sprint since November 2019. It will be partly hybrid with regular
online meetings with developers not on site.

# Gammapy Coding Sprint, June 2022,

* Start: Monday, June 27th, 2022 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, July 1st, 2022 at noon

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **want to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop on how to use Gammapy.

This is the first in-person coding-sprint since November 2019. It will be partly hybrid with regular
online meetings with developers not on site.

Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Zoom.

A Zoom room will be open the full week. 

Communication via Slack on #dev channel in the meantime.

## Suggestions for accommodation
To reach UAB one can take a train from downtown Barcelona, either from [Plaça de Catalunya](https://goo.gl/maps/zkR5ZBv6hJTQxwTx9) or from [Estación de Gràcia](https://goo.gl/maps/eAc83U1GwcQmYqYS9). You might want to keep in mind that the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) that [will host the Gamma2022]((https://indico.icc.ub.edu/event/46/page/29-venue)) the following week is on the green metro line, L3, accessible from both stations (not directly from Gràcia, but you can walk to [Fontana](https://goo.gl/maps/X24vCN3t5z3VKvFj7) in 2 mins). If finding an accommodation in the center of the city or near Plaça de Catalunya is difficult, searching in the [Vila de Gràcia](https://goo.gl/maps/mLa9xDCkhU9NnbpH9) can be a valid alternative.

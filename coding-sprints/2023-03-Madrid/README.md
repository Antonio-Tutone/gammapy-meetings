# Gammapy Coding Sprint / Co-working week, March 2023

* Start: Monday, March 20th, 2023 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, March 24th, 2023 at noon

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **want to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop on how to use Gammapy.

Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Zoom.

A Zoom room will be open the full week.

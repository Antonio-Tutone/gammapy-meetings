This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people who commit to develop Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). The objective is to distribute tasks defined
in several PIGS and implement new features in Gammapy.
This is **not** a workshop how to use Gammapy. We will also not do any tutorials how to hack on Gammapy, i.e. teach
git, Github, Python, pytest and Sphinx. Instead we will pair experienced and new
people and learn hands-on. If you want to prepare a bit, have a look at
[gammapy-dev-tutorial](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-dev-tutorial) and
learn a bit on your own before the coding sprint. Join the [Gammapy Slack](https://gammapy.slack.com) and
feel free to ask anything there.

## Brief points to start the discussion

1. Add doc-example/functionality for for p-value - add in HowTo
2. Dealing with multiple models simultaneously - adding models to datasets - add in HowTo
3. Some links broken in HowTo
4. Relationship between models and datasets, specially in case of joint fitting between datasets
5. Use of the the CompoundSpectralModel is unclear
6. How to compute the significance of a model 
7. GaussianSpatialModel.to_region() should mention the number of sigmas of the regions
8. Have it as an optional argument to the function as well?
9. Add FoVBackgroundMaker in makers introduction along with Reflected and Ring
10. Estimator docs need to be improved as per makers and datasets
11. ExcessProfileEstimator and ImageEstimator almost undocumented
12. https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/stats/index.html#id1 - The code lines not executed for excess and significance
13. Shorten and improve the overview page by adding a figure: https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/overview.html 
14. Link to older versions

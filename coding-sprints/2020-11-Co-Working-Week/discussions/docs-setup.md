- Remove gammapy download notebooks and gammapy download scripts
- Keep links to nobtebooks and scripts for each notebook at the top of the html pages
- Display the collection of tutorials as a gallery and re-structure groups?
- Improve [speed execution](nbs_exectime.txt) of some notebooks 
- Execute python code found in RST pages?
- Problems found diffing nbs with widgets?
- Other options for the setup (jupytext)
- Improve /automatize release process?
- Maintenance: broken links and sphinx builds

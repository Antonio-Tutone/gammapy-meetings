* Start: Monday, March 2nd, 2020 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, March 6th, 2020 at noon
* Location: "Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche", Via A. Corti, 12, Milano (https://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/)

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **want to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop how to use Gammapy. We will also **not**
do any tutorials how to hack on Gammapy, i.e. teach git, Github, Python, pytest and Sphinx.

## Travel

Milan is served by three airports: Linate, Malpensa and Orio al Serio.

Linate (LIN) is the ‘city’ airport connected to the urban bus network as well as by (more expensive) direct coaches to Central Station; with a standard urban ticket you can get to the institute taking bus 73 and changing to trolleybus 93 (or bus 45, see planner map). Journey by public transport can take from 30 to 40 minutes.
A taxi from Linate to IASF will cost ~20 euros.

Malpensa (MXP, 43 km NW) is the airport where most of intercontinental flights land (Terminal 1). It is also the favourite hub by Easyjet flights from/to Europe (Terminal 2). Connections from/to Malpensa are secured by fast train Malpensa Express, leaving either from Cadorna or Centrale Station (the latter transit also at Porta Garibaldi). There is one train every 15 minutes in peak hours, and the journey lasts from 40 to 55 minutes, according to the train.
Since trains to Cadorna and Centrale alternate, it is advised to catch the first train anyhow: for trains going to Cadorna stay onboard until the terminus and continue by underground as described above; for trains to Centrale it is quicker to alight at Porta Garibaldi and continue by underground too. Tickets can be bought on line here (see also Trenord timetable).
There are also cheaper coaches from/to Central Station. Travel time by bus is approximately 45 minutes, but during day-time on work days may become unpredictable.
Taxis from Malpensa apply a flat fare of 90 euros to anywhere in town.

Orio al Serio (BGY, 43 km NE) is the main airport for RyanAir flights. It is connected to Milan only by coaches to Central station.

## Public transport

The Institute is easily reachable by public transport, being within walking distance (2-3 blocks) from the Metro Green line (M2) stations of Piola or Lambrate. The Lambrate railway station is instead served by some suburban rail lines and very few long distance train.

The Metro Green line also serves other railway stations like: Milano Centrale (Central Railway Station), where most long distance trains arrive, and where buses from Linate and Malpensa airports and half of the trains from Malpensa airport have their terminal; Milano Porta Garibaldi (suburban rail lines, some long distance trains and the same trains from Malpensa airport); and Cadorna (Stazione Nord), where trains (Malpensa Express, every 30 minutes) from Malpensa airport, and some suburban lines, arrive.

Trams no. 33 and 19 and trolleybus no. 93 go along via Bassini.

Info on public transport fares and map is on the ATM website (https://www.atm.it/en/Pages/default.aspx). A day ticket may be a convenient choice.

## Map Link / Hotels

IASF/Milano does not have any agreement with hotels or B&B. 
However, people visiting IASF/Milano have given good references for the Hotel Gamma (https://hotelgammamilano.it/en/), Hotel Lugano (http://www.luganohotel.net/it/) and Hotel Vienna (http://www.hotelviennamilano.com/).

## Location of the meeting

Building access:
Access to IASF/Milano occurs only from the gate in 'via Alfonso Corti, 12' (entrance of CNR). Register at the reception, exit in the yard and cross it to reach the Bassini building. 

Due to construction works in the CNR premises, entrance to our building occurs preferentially via one lift, at the right of the building.

The offices and rooms of IASF Milano occupy the entire 4th floor of the Bassini building.

## Lunch

An istitute canteen is available everyday from 12:00 to 14:00. The typical price is around 4-6 euros.
Otherwise, outside the IASF/Milano building, a number of close restaurants, bar, pizzerie and pubs are available with a rich gastronomical proposal. A typical cost for the lunch is around 6-20 euros.

## Dinner

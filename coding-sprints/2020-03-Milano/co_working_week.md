# Gammapy Co-Working Week, March 2020

Instead of the planned coding sprint in Milano, we have a "Gammapy co-working week" from 2nd to 6th March 2020.  Ideally all participants can dedicate most of your time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Vibe. 

In between communication via Slack: https://gammapy.slack.com (#dev channel)

## Agenda

Monday afternoon 14h00: kick off meeting with presentations on Vibe

Presentations:
- Axel: Introduction and overview
- Axel: Model handling
- Fabio: Event sampling status (validation and missing features)
- Atreyee: Temporal model evaluation

- Rest of the week: 10h00 regular status meeting on Vibe

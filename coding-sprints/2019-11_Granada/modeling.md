# Modeling

Notes by Christoph

## Status

- We introduced `gammapy.modeling` and `gammapy.modeling.models`. See [docs](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/modeling/index.html#reference-api) [PIG 16](https://docs.gammapy.org/0.14/development/pigs/pig-016.html)
- tbd

## Next steps

- I proposed to hire Tom to work on Gammapy modeling with us. Did not happen. Recommend strongly you do it in 2020, and schedule it early (half a year in advance). What we have is a prototype that can be sped up ~ 100x if we do coordinates, model evaluation, gradients, caching and multi-core CPU usage well.
- But let's focus on high-priority bugs and features and things we can maybe achieve in the next weeks.

# The joint-crab project
The joint-crab project represents the first reproducible, multi-instrument gamma-ray analysis using data from 
_Fermi_-LAT, MAGIC, VERITAS, FACT and H.E.S.S.    
Data manipulation and statistical analysis are handled by `gammapy`.       
The material to produce the project results (data, scripts, notebooks) is available online in [GitHub](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/joint-crab.git).    
The project is discussed in this [A&A issue](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/05/aa34938-18/aa34938-18.html).

  * Would like to cut Gammapy 0.7 release at the end of this week.
* CTA 1DC update (Roberta or Christoph)
  * Released August 30 via email to all CTA members

* HESS test data release update (Christoph)
  * TODO: link to new FITS files and status of tests / remaining tasks.
* TBC: energy dispersion and safe energy threshold (Cosimo, Julien, Johannes)
* TBC: sensitivity computation (Bruno)
* You: issues, feature requests, analysis results, ...!???
* Next steps (All)
  * CTA PHYS meeting next week (Sep 18-20):
    * https://indico.cta-observatory.org/event/1471/?ovw=True
    * Anyone have time to run a Gammapy analysis and present first impressions?
    * Are there things we can fix in Gammapy quickly this week to support 1DC?
  * Gammapy coding sprint next week (Sep 21-22):
    * See infos at [2017-09_Heidelberg.md](../2017-09_Heidelberg.md) 
    * What should be our main focus and goal(s)? Short discussion now or next week?
  * Anyone willing to be "manager" for writing the
    Gammapy paper?
    * Your role would be to drive the effort by organising discussions, distributing tasks, reviewing pull requests as they come in (i.e. somewhat of an editor role), set a timeline and goal and make sure it gets done.
    * You don't have to have lots of contributions to the Gammapy code or have the time or ambition to produce a lot of text / code examples / figures yourself.
    * The paper should be relatively short and a "minimum complete draft" be ready within ~ a month. Github repo already exists: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-paper

  * But very few software developments in the past weeks, activity we had at and after the coding sprint did not continue.
  * Most discussions currently on time analysis (pulsars, binaries, AGN) - see presentations by Marion, Bruno & Lab below
  * We didn't manage to talk about spectrum simulations this week. Maybe early next week?
  * Regis and I will talk today at 3 pm to try and organise developments (especially 3D, 1D, modeling, time)
    a bit, see what is needed / possible within the next weeks, but also months, and then contact some of you
    asking to take charge or or contribute to one of those topics.

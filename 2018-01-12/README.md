# Agenda

* Updates
  * We've started to organise the Gammapy project and team, see http://gammapy.org/team.html
    Defined coordination committee, project manager and lead developer roles and responsibilities.
    Plan to define more roles and responsibilities in the Gammapy team (e.g. sub-package maintainers)
    at the F2F meeting in Paris.
  * Gammapy documentation moved from ReadTheDocs to Github Pages
    Now here: http://docs.gammapy.org/dev/, http://docs.gammapy.org/stable/
    Some more work to do, see [GH 1241](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/1241#issuecomment-356444740)
  * Now that we have gammapy.org, we're doing some re-organisation of docs.gammapy.org
    E.g. remove this page: http://docs.gammapy.org/0.6/about.html
  * We introduced a good process to plan and discuss changes for Gammapy.
    "Proposals for improvement of Gammapy (PIGs)"
    See discussion in [GH 1239](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/1239)
    and result in  [PIG 1](http://docs.gammapy.org/dev/development/pigs/)

    and for modeling by Christoph (started writing a PIG, coding will start next week)

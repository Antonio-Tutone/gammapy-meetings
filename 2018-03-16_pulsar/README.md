# Gammapy and PINT pulsar analysis

* Friday, March 16, 2018 at 2pm
* CTA eZuce, password "gammapypulsar".  The connection details are [here](ConnectionsDetails.txt)

# Agenda

* DC1 pulsars
* Phasing the time column in the DC1
* Status on PINT
* Pulsar spectra

# A few points

* [Alexander's presentation on DC1 pulsars from September 2017](https://indico.cta-observatory.org/login/?next=%2Fevent%2F1471%2Fcontributions%2F13733%2Fattachments%2F11980%2F13700%2FBurtovoi_DC1_Pulsars_PHYS_F2F_Heidelberg_20170918_v3.pdf)

* The [PhaseCurve](http://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.time.models.PhaseCurve.html) class can be used to compute the phases for the DC1 pulsars

* 12 pulsars have been selected but it doesn't mean that they are all featured in the simulations, depending on the portion of the sky in which they are

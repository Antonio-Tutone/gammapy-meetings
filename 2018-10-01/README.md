# Gammapy Coding Sprint, October 2018, Madrid

* Start: Monday, October 1, 2018 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, October 5, 2018 at noon
* Location: MPIK Heidelberg, Germany (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/)
* Contacts (local organisers):
[Jose Luis Contreras](mailto:jlcontreras@fis.ucm.es),

So far Gammapy has been mostly developed and used by people working on CTA and H.E.S.S.
But of course anyone is welcome! If you're from MAGIC, VERITAS, HAWC, KM3Net, ... and have time to come and talk to us, please do!

This is a "coding sprint" for people that want to work on Gammapy (http://gammapy.org/)
You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to Gammapy yet.
But note that this is not a workshop how to use Gammapy. We will also not do any tutorials how to hack on Gammapy, i.e. teach git, Github, Python, pytest and Sphinx. Instead we will pair experienced and new people and learn hands-on. If you want to prepare a bit, have a look at [gammapy-dev-tutorial](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-dev-tutorial) and learn a bit on your own before the coding sprint. Join the Gammapy Slack and feel free to ask anything there.

## Travel and hotel

If you haven't been to Heidelberg or MPIK, you can find some information [here](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/contact/access-and-site-map/). MPIK is located a bit up the hill outside of Heidelberg, a 10 min ride with bus 39 will get you there.

To book a hotel or Airbnb, please do it yourself.
Good areas are downtown or Weststadt or Südstadt, i.e. near the bus line 39 that you will want to take to go to MPIK.
But really, Heidelberg is small and there are no "bad neighborhoods", you can stay anywhere you like.

There is the option to stay at the MPIK guest house. It's cheap, 35 Euro / night, see [price list](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/fileadmin/files-mpi/2015_price_list_MPIK_guest_houses.pdf), good WIFI and easy to book by filling out [this form](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/information-for/reservation/#2899). But most people prefer to stay in downtown Heidelberg to see a bit from the city and to have a shorter way home in the evening after dinner. There is no canteen at MPIK, only at nearby EMBL where we also go for lunch, and it closes at 7 pm.

Let us know if you have any questions!

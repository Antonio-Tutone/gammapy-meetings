# About

**We are organising a 3 day "bootcamp" to get people started or become better with Python, Numpy, Astropy, Gammapy, ctapipe, ... as a user or contributor.**

There's a wide range of existing skill levels ("never used Python" to "Gammapy
or ctapipe developer"). We'll have to compromise a bit. We'll start with
absolute basics on day 1, and go all the way to use Gammapy and ctapipe for some
data analysis and make a first pull request with a small contribution on day 3.
It'll be hands-on, with exercises. We'll roughly cover the things listed on
Slide 5 here:
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra/raw/master/presentations/2017-01-13_Gammapy.pdf
but level and content will be adjusted to make it useful for most people based
an your replies below.

**This will be mostly an MPIK-internal workshop, but everyone is welcome to join!**
If you come visit, let us know if you need a recommendation for a hotel or want to stay in the MPIK guest house.

There will be larger Gammapy meeting (at APC Paris the week after) and ctapipe
meetings (at MPIK) in the coming months. We also plan to have this be a kick-off
bootcamp, and then start regular bi-weekly "code café" or "analysis café" where
we meet for a few hours. More about that later.

If there is interest, we can use Thursday and Friday to split up and into groups
of 2-3 people and do some detailed discussions or pair coding. E.g. to help you
to script your H.E.S.S. or CTA science analysis, or to work on a pull request
for ctapipe or Gammapy to add some feature you want.

# Agenda

## CTA DC-1 Analyses

We will start with a status report on CTA DC-1 check analyses.

Please try to have results ready: put scripts or notebooks that write
results in machine-readable format, stored in version control, summarised in README.
In the presentation, please be quick (10 min max) and focus on open issues and questions.
